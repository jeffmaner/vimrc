vimrc
=====

My \_vimrc for the most awesome [gVim][1].

Added some functionality I find quite useful after reading [Learn Vimscript the
Hard Way][2]. He mentions, after posting one's vimrc to, e.g. GitHub, replacing
`$HOME/_vimrc` with a symlink to the vimrc file that will actually be backed up.
Excellent idea!
